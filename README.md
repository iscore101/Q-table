# Q-table

## Installation

The installation only requires cloning into the desired location.

## Execution

The Q-table repo is modeled after the hello-python example, so theoretically it can be run the same way, with the following relevant changes:

* main.py is now scaling.py
* all instances of `hello_python` in `Dockerfile` and `deployment.yaml` were changed to `scaling`
* `scaling.py` now contains two methods that use the flask app, both with rule `'/'`:
    * `update_json_data()`, a `'POST'` method that updates `json_data`, and
    * `send_action()`, a `'GET'` method that returns the `action` generated by the `q-learner`

It may be necessary to change the arguments of `scaling.py` line 145, the construction of the q_learner, with the appropriate values as defined in `one_op.py`.

I believe it would be best to run it on simple examples, e.g. source $\to$ sink, because the code is mostly for now designed for single source/sink and is largely untested.
